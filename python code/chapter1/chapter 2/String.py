#####  String
## Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks. 
## 'hello' is the same as "hello". 
## You can display a string literal with the print() function:

#Example : 
print(" This is a String \n" )


### Quotes Inside Quotes
## you can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:
# Example : 

print("It's alright")
print("He is called Johnny's ")
print('He is called Johnny"s \n')


### Assign String to a Variable
## Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string: 

#example : 
a = ("This is a sting : ")
print(a)


print()
### Multiline Strings 
## You can use three double quotes:
# Example : 

a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. \n"""
print(a)
